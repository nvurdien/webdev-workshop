**Introduction**

Hello, this is a short tutorial to make a quick personal website with limited knowledge on web development.
You can use any of the template links below to create your website.
Depending on the type of website you choose I will have a guide on how to create your own personal website on github!
I put stars (<i class="fa fa-star"></i>) near the ones that I recommend for you guys to use.

**HTML/CSS/Javascript Template Websites**
  * [HTML5up](https://html5up.net) <i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i>
  * [Creative Tim](https://www.creative-tim.com) <i class="fa fa-star"></i>
  * [FreebiesBug](https://freebiesbug.com/code-stuff/html-website-templates/)

  * [Templated.co](https://templated.co)
  * [Templatemo](http://www.templatemo.com/page/1)

There's more than just this list you can just google search for free website templates online as well. I prefer HTML5up though.
A lot of the information on how to use these should be pretty straight forward however if you have any questions you can contact me anytime with the information listed below.
