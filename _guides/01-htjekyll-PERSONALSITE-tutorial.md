**Deploying to Github**

Create a repository named <insertGithubUserNameHere>.github.io without the '<>'

In this tutorial, my username is nvurdienn so my repository would be named nvurdienn.github.io

Once you have done that set up Git on your computer, if you haven't already. If you have a Mac/Linux, Git should be preinstalled on your system; however, if you have windows you should download <a href="https://desktop.github.com" target="_blank">Github Desktop</a>. Instructions on how to set up Git through command line are listed <a href="http://burnedpixel.com/blog/setting-up-git-and-github-on-your-mac/" target="_blank">here</a>. Linux/Mac users may also set up Git by downloading and logging into <a href="https://desktop.github.com" target="_blank">Github Desktop</a>.

Then add all the files into that repository and congrats you have successfully created your personal page!

The page would be at <insertGithubUserNameHere>.github.io

As an example, the username used in this tutorial would be nvurdienn.github.io
