**Setting up**

Once you have downloaded/saved your website template, it will show up in wherever you set up your download folder.

Go to that folder and open the main/homepage/index html file in any text editor of your choice (I recommend <a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a> or <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime</a>)

In example, mine is labeled **index.html**.

You can also see how you are editing your site in realtime by opening the HTML document in your browser and refreshing the page.

You can debug your site by right-clicking (if you are on Windows/Linux) or control+click (if you are on a Mac) and selecting the "Inspect Elements" option which should come with every browser.

**Deploying to Github**

Create a repository named <insertGithubUserNameHere>.github.io without the '<>'

In this tutorial, my username is nvurdienn so mine would be nvurdienn.github.io

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/jkVeHWa.gifv">

Then add all the files into that repository and congrats you have successfully created your personal page!

The page would be at <insertGithubUserNameHere>.github.io

As an example, the username used in this tutorial would be nvurdienn.github.io
